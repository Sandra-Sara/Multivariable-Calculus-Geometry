 4. Suppose that a box has its faces parallel to the coordinate planes and the points (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2)
 are endpoints of a diagonal.
 (a) Find the coordinates of the remaining six corners.
 (b) Show that the midpoint of the line segment joining
 (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) is
 (1/2(x1+x2),1/2(y1+y2),1/2(z1+z2) )
 ans of a:
 All eight corners are the eight choices of taking either 
𝑥1 or x2 for the x-coordinate, either 
𝑦1 or 𝑦2 for the y-coordinate, and either 𝑧1​ or 𝑧2 for the 
z-coordinate. Thus the corners are(𝑥1,𝑦1,𝑧1),(𝑥1,𝑦1,𝑧2),(𝑥1,𝑦2,𝑧1),(𝑥1,𝑦2,𝑧2)(𝑥2,𝑦1,𝑧1),(𝑥2,𝑦1,𝑧2),(𝑥2,𝑦2,𝑧1),(𝑥2,𝑦2,𝑧2).(x1,y1,z1),(x1,y1,z2),(x1,y2,z1),(x1,y2,z2),(x2,y1,z1),(x2,y1,z2),
(x2,y2,z1),(x2,y2,z2).
If the given diagonal endpoints are (𝑥1,𝑦1,𝑧1)(x1,y1,z1) and (𝑥2,𝑦2,𝑧2)(x2,y2,z2), the remaining six corners are the six listed above excluding the two given points, i.e.
(𝑥1,𝑦1,𝑧2),(𝑥1,𝑦2,𝑧1),(𝑥1,𝑦2,𝑧2),(𝑥2,𝑦1,𝑧1),(𝑥2,𝑦1,𝑧2),(𝑥2,𝑦2,𝑧1).(x1,y1,z2), (x1,y2,z1), (x1,y2,z2), (x2,y1,z1), (x2,y1,z2), (x2,y2,z1).

Various Combination of (1,1,1) & (2,2,2)
(1,1,2),(1,2,1),(1,2,2),(2,1,1),(2,1,2),(2,2,1)


(b) The midpoint of the diagonal has coordinates which are the coordinates of the midpoints of the edges. The midpoint of the edge (x1 y1 z1) and (x2 y1 z1) is (1/2(x1 +x2),y1,z1); the midpoint of the edge (x2 y1 z1) and (x2 y2 z1) is x2,1/2(y1 +y2),z1 ; the midpoint of the edge (x2 y2 z1) and (x2 y2 z2) is (x2,y2,1/2(z1 +z2)).
 Thus the coordinates of the midpoint of the diagonal are(1/2(x1 + x2),1/2(y1 + y2),1/2(z1 + z2)).




 17.A sphere has center in the first octant and is tangent to each
 of the three coordinate planes. Show that the center of the
 sphere is at a point of the form (r,r,r),where r is the radius
 of the sphere.
 Ans:Let the sphere have center (𝑎,𝑏,𝑐)
(a,b,c) with 𝑎,𝑏,𝑐>0
(first octant) and radius 𝑟>0

The three coordinate planes are x=0, y=0, and z=0.

The distance from the center (a,b,c) to the plane x=0 is ∣a∣. Because the sphere is tangent to 
x=0, that distance equals the radius:∣a∣=r.

Since 
a>0, we have a=r. Similarly tangency to y=0 and z=0 gives ∣b∣=r and ∣c∣=r, hence b=r and c=r.

Therefore the center is (r,r,r). (The points of tangency are (r,0,0),(0,r,0),(0,0,r).)
